#### Next, we will demonstrate NFT GO from the perspectives of merchants and consumers.

##### Merchant

1. As a merchant, you can create NFTs. On the right side of the NFT Gallery in the User interface, you can see a button called "Create NFTs+". 

2. <img src="/Users/laihongyue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20231202173806527.png" alt="image-20231202173806527" style="zoom:33%;" />

3. After clicking it, you can enter the NFT creation interface. You need to enter the name, discount, validity period (in seconds), and image of the NFT you want to create (**it is not recommended to exceed 500KB**, otherwise bugs may occur). 

4. After clicking "Create", you will be redirected to the MetaMask interface, which will ask you to pay the fee for creating the NFT. 

5. After successful creation, you can go back to the NFT Gallery in the User interface to view your successfully created NFTs (new NFTs may take some time to update and display, please be patient and refresh the page).

   > Note: As a merchant, the NFTs you create can be extracted. Once a user wins the extraction, this NFT will disappear from your NFT Gallery, and the user who wins the extraction will automatically deduct the corresponding discount from their transfer to you within the validity period of the NFT.



##### Consumer

As a consumer, you can extract NFTs. Enter the Search interface, enter the nickname of the merchant, and you can get the NFTs available for extraction by the merchant.

 Click "Draw NFT" below to extract. After the extraction is completed, you can go back to the NFT Gallery in the User interface to see if you have successfully extracted the NFT (new NFTs may take some time to update and display, please be patient and refresh the page).



> Note: 
>
> - You may not be able to extract NFTs due to insufficient points. **To obtain points, you need to click "Transfer" to transfer funds to the merchant (corresponding to "consumption" in reality)**.
>   -  You will receive points equal to the amount transferred. After clicking "Transfer", you will be prompted to enter the amount to be transferred. 
>   - Due to the scheduling of the smart contract API, you may need to go through three transfers on MetaMask (two of which are gas fees and one is the actual transfer fee).
>
> - **Points are universal.** 
>   - The points you obtain from Merchant A can be used to extract NFTs from Merchant B. You can check how many points you have in the "User Info" section of the User interface.
> - **You will randomly receive one NFT from the NFTs owned by the merchant** (with a certain probability of winning). 
>   - If you hold a specific NFT, you can enjoy the corresponding discount when transferring funds to the merchant within the validity period of the NFT.
